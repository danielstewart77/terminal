"""Who may reach which route: one table, enforced in front of every route.

Every route is classified in a single table. The classes are:

- `public` — no sign-in (the sign-in page itself, health, static files, and
  routes that check a bearer of their own).
- `self` — any signed-in user, including one who must still change their
  password (the change-password page).
- `user` — any signed-in user; the handler filters what it lists to what
  the user owns (`visible_minds`, `visible_sessions`).
- `owner` — a route about one mind, named by a path parameter. The table
  declares which parameter and how it resolves (a mind's name or id, a
  session id, an operation's request id) to the owning user. An admin
  passes; anyone else passes only as that owner. An owner that cannot be
  resolved — comms down, an unknown mind, a mind with no owner — refuses.
- `admin` — admins only.
- `bearer` — reached only with the bearer the rule names (a mind
  publishing); no session admits it.

Any rule may also name a bearer (`Rule(..., bearer="design")`): a request
presenting one is admitted by that bearer and nothing else. The middleware
verifies it against the table's token before the route runs — scheme
compared without regard to case, value in constant time — and a wrong one
is refused, never answered from the cookie beside it. A route reads what was
verified with `bearer_of(request)`; it never reads the header itself. A
request carrying more than one Authorization header is refused outright,
since two readers of one request could otherwise each believe a different
one.

A long-lived connection — a websocket, a streamed response — is decided
again every `RECHECK_SECONDS` for as long as it stays open, so a disable, a
reset or an owner moved ends it rather than waiting for its next request.
A refused websocket is accepted and then closed with its reason's code
(4401, 4403, 4428), because a browser never sees the code of a socket closed
before it was accepted.

A route missing from the table is `admin`. That default is what makes a
page added later safe without its author doing anything; websocket routes
are classified the same way.

The middleware is pure ASGI so websockets pass through it too, and it
decides before the route runs, so a handler with no authorization code of
its own is still covered. This module knows nothing of the app around it:
the console and the terminal each hand it their own table and resolvers.
