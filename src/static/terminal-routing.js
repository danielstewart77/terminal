/* Reattach routing for the web terminal.
 *
 * When a terminal tile's socket drops it has to decide what to reconnect
 * to. Getting this wrong is not cosmetic: the previous rule was "any live
 * session on the same mind", so with two tiles open the reconnecting one
 * adopted its neighbour's conversation, took its neighbour's name and
 * colour with it, and left the neighbour blank.
 *
 * The rules, in order:
 *   1. The same session, if it is still live. The pty now outlives the
 *      socket, so this is the ordinary case — a dropped connection, not a
 *      dead conversation.
 *   2. The session that rotation created to replace it, identified by
 *      recorded lineage (rotated_from) and not by proximity.
 *   3. Nothing. Waiting beats stealing.
 *
 * A session another tile already has open is never a candidate.
